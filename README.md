## Interested in contributing?

If you have any suggestions on improving the application, any code refactoring that you can do for improvement just fork the repository and start contributing. Any help in contribution is greatly appreciated.

## Note

This repository contains just the front-end part of the application. The back-end is built on Node.js and is not open source because it has many API keys that need to be private for security purposes. If you are interested, I can give you the source code of the back-end after removing the API keys.
